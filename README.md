# SpaceX Project

My final project I developed for my Backend class. Took an online API and used it to grab data of all past, current, and future SpaceX launches. I used that data to make a web app that displayed a countdown timer to the next upcoming launch. Also display information about that upcoming launch such as the rocket type, emblem, the crew on board, and the time it was launching. Also provided info on past launches giving their date of launch and description of the mission as well as future launches and their mission description.

This was my very first project. I plan to slowly add improvements here and there as I learn and gain more knowledge.
